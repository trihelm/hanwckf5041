ATTENTION:
 - After the first upgrade from official firmware, all settings will be erased. Do not load
   settings (CFG file) from official firmware!!!
 - After upgrade from any official ASUS firmware, WAN MAC address for RT-N14U/N11P is dynamically
   changed (not permanent) in last octet. Please check MAC binding from your ISP.

WARNING:
These features are NO LONGER AVAILABLE:
 - WPS/WSC (completely disabled due to the serious security hole).
